    //   postDescription: `Jumpstart’s mission is to make the world more equitable by building a collaborative talent marketplace that creates more opportunity for everyone. And while we advance towards this vision daily, it’s not lost on us that so many communities still face heightened barriers to opportunity.\nThat’s why we are so thrilled and honored to be partnering with Nextplay Community, the organization that is working to close the economic gap and bolster career development for Black and LatinX professionals.\nNextplay works to achieve their mission by hosting networking events centered around culture. To experience this partnership in action, make sure to check out Nextplay’s Anniversary networking event happening December 10th, hosted on Jumpstart. You’ll have the opportunity to network with fellow Black and LatinX professionals, as well as connect with organizations looking to hire.\nRSVP:<a target="blank" href="https://jumpstart.me/discover/events/a/a/efb284d4-f352-4f91-94b4-d9b5b1498d14">https://jumpstart.me/discover/events/a/a/efb284d4-f352-4f91-94b4-d9b5b1498d14</a>`,
